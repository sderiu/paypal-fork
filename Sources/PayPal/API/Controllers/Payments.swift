/// Use the Payments REST API to easily and securely accept online and mobile payments.
/// The payments name space contains resource collections for payments, sales, refunds, authorizations, captures, and orders.
///
/// - Important: The use of the PayPal REST /payments APIs to accept credit card payments is restricted.
///   Instead, you can accept credit card payments with [Braintree Direct](https://www.braintreepayments.com/products/braintree-direct).
///
/// You can enable customers to make PayPal and credit card payments with only a few clicks, depending on the country.
/// You can accept an immediate payment or authorize a payment and capture it later. You can show details for completed payments, refunds,
/// and authorizations. You can make full or partial refunds. You also can void or re-authorize authorizations. For more information,
/// see the [Payments overview](https://developer.paypal.com/docs/integration/direct/payments/).
///
/// ## Payment
///
/// Use the `/payment` resource to create a _sale_, an _authorized payment_, or an _order_. A sale is a direct credit card payment,
/// stored credit card payment, or PayPal payment. An authorized payment places funds on hold to be captured later. An order is a purchase
/// that a customer has approved but for which the funds are not placed on hold. You can also use this resource to execute approved
/// PayPal payments and show details for, update, and list payments. For more information, see also
/// [Payments](https://developer.paypal.com/docs/integration/direct/payments/).
///
/// ## Sale
///
/// A sale is a completed payment. Use the `/sale` resource to show sale details and refund a sale. For more information, see also Refund payments.
///
/// ## Authorization
///
/// Use the `/authorization` resource and related sub-resources to show details for, capture, void, and reauthorize an authorization.
///
/// ## Orders
///
/// Use the `/orders` resource to authorize, capture, void, and show details for an order.
///
/// - Note: You cannot refund an order directly. Instead, you must refund a completed payment for an order.
///   For integration information, see Orders and refund a payment.
///
/// ## Capture
///
/// Use the `/capture` resource and sub-resources to show details for and refund captured payments.
///
/// ## Refund
///
/// Use the `/refund` resource to show details for a refund on direct and captured payments.
